    Going into this I was having difficulty grasping the idea of websites dying and becoming less savory. My exposure to the web consisted of using a family member's computer and at times getting to play random games  i.e Scary Maze game, random dress up games, and educational games.  The web also consisted of using it for research purposes during school. I was being taught all the best search functions and multiple ways to best use the internet to credit my research. All in all the web was bleak for me growing up, it wasn't for entertainment purposes until apps came out and then the internet  became more accessible for me.

<p>
    Reading into how people were able to customize sites and glitterfy it, I can see how the argument of websites becoming less savory can be put into place. So with that perspective the websites we have now don't compare to the customization function of sites from the earlier years.  Although, I do believe the new way of customizations are now for personal sites i.e., portfolio sites, shops, blogs, etc. It takes creating a site for yourself or a company to implement what sites are missing nowadays, which is personality.

    Following up on creating sites, UX and UI web designers are what makes these decisions. UX / Ui designers are able to lead companies in certain directions of the design of their website for functionality purposes. Wagner says, "Because websites had to either become apps or self-optimize for mobile, web design declined from its creative, more variegated heights to become flat, highly minimalistic, and multi-platform, and the results are, frankly, fucking boring." Personally I don't think sites are being minimized and simplified for no reason, I believe it has to do with the functionality and user experience of certain sites.  So with that in mind, I don't feel like I'm missing out on customizing a site and controlling it to fit my design choices.

    As the web was becoming more constrained, less used, and "boring", companies moved towards putting their efforts and ideas into apps. Over the years the usage of the internet has adapted to smartphones and apps leaving behind the web . With this new age of apps Wagner argues that what we have access to is now more restrictive and limited. Wagner describes apps as being "... completely misaligned with the earlier ethos of the internet as a place for the open-ended exchange of ideas." I think this does have to do with the impact of phones itself. Phones are now an everyday usage and we use them for everything. 
</p>

<p>
    Once again I do have difficulty understanding the change of using the web to now using apps because of my limited access to the internet in the past. So instead I'll voice my opinion on apps vs the web now and how I currently view them. 
</p>

<p>
    To begin with there's a very clear distinction between both. The web is most effective on a desktop or laptop and when it comes to apps they are best used on phones. Personally I still believe that the web is a place for open-ended exchange of ideas. Most recently I've dived into doing extensive research for design projects and with finding information and inspiration I have come across many many websites that include a multitude of ideas. Would I consider them flat and boring, I would say it applied to some sites. At the end of the day I'm getting the information I need and whether the site looks pretty or not, it's effective. Overall I use websites for what they are, if they're interactive that adds to the fun of it, but the majority of time is spent on apps and companies are making ways to make them more interesting.
