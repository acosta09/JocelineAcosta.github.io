		October's Bright Blue Weather
		</h1>
		<div id="ah">
<p>
O suns and skies and clouds of June, <br />
And flowers of June together, <br />
Ye cannot rival for one hour <br />
October's bright blue weather.
</p>

<p>
When loud the humblebee makes haste, <br />
Belated, thriftless vagrant, <br />
And Golden-Rod is dying fast, <br />
And lanes with grapes are fragrant;
</p>

<p>
When Gentians roll their fringes tight <br />
To save them for the morning, <br />
And chestnuts fall from satin burrs <br />
Without a sound of warning;
</p>

<p>
When on the ground red apples lie <br />
In piles like jewels shining, <br />
And redder still on old stone walls <br />
Are leaves of woodbine twining;
</p>

<p>
When all the lovely wayside things <br />
Their white-winged seeds are sowing, <br />
And in the fields, still green and fair, <br />
Late aftermaths are growing;
</p>

<p>
When springs run low, and on the brooks, <br />
In idle golden freighting, <br />
Bright leaves sink noiseless in the hush <br />
Of woods, for winter waiting;
</p>

<p>
When comrades seek sweet country haunts, <br />
By two and two together, <br />
And count like misers , hour by hour, <br />
October's bright blue weather.
</p>

<p>
O suns and skies and flowers of June, <br />
Count all your boasts together, <br />
Love loveth best of all the year <br />
October's bright blue weather.
</p>

				About a 2 weeks ago from today a professor I have presented this quote for us. It was up on display , he recited the poem. He then turned and said this was his mothers favorite poem, and how he reads it every year in memory of his mother. He then presented us with the question of, Why do you think October is being asscoiated with the color blue.
			</p>

				I think its like a way of saying goodbye to the summer. Summer is correlated with bright blue skies and warm weather. In contrast to October which is known as a fall season. Skies start getting darker and colors start changing. As I read the poem it was initially talking about Junes weather and the farther you read along it transitioned into talking about Octobers weather and attributes. So all in all its about transitioning into new times, appreciating the old, but looking forward to the new.   </p>
